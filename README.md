# C++ Project Template
This template relies on SharpMake by Ubisoft as project generation tool. It is primarily meant to work with Visual Studio and VS plugin [CppSourceManager](https://github.com/rtojagic/cpp-source-manager).

### How to contribute?
1. Make sure you have cloned the repo with `git clone https://github.com/rtojagic/cpp-template.git`.
2. Now, find the issue you want to solve, for example let's see issue [#4](https://github.com/rtojagic/cpp-template/issues/4). Figure out a reasonable and short name, in this example it could be `ps_bootstrap` and make a new branch with that name using `git checkout -b ps_bootstrap`.
3. Add and commit your files.
4. Make a pull request and wait for the approval or change requests.

Thanks!
